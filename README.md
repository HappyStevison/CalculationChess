Week 1: Foundation Building – Basic Calculation and Visualization
Goal: Strengthen visualization and calculation of short tactical sequences.

Day 1–2: Visualization Basics
Warm-up (10-15 mins): Set up random positions from games. Visualize moves without moving the pieces. Imagine 2-3 moves ahead (for both sides).
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve easy tactics puzzles (0–1200 rating range on Lichess/Chess.com). Focus on seeing 2-3 moves ahead clearly.
Blindfold Practice (15 mins): Play simple positions in your head or with a friend (e.g., king + pawns vs. king). Practice visualizing all moves without looking at the board.
Game Analysis (30 mins): Pick a master game and play through it move-by-move. Pause and guess the next move, visualizing the board after each move.
Day 3–4: Basic Tactical Patterns
Warm-up (10-15 mins): Visualize short tactical sequences (e.g., a knight fork, discovered attack). Move the pieces in your head.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve tactics puzzles (slightly harder, 1200–1400 rating). Focus on common patterns like forks, pins, skewers, and discovered attacks.
Calculation Exercise (30 mins): Pick a position from a game or puzzle. Write down your candidate moves and calculate 2-3 moves deep for each, imagining the resulting positions.
Optional Blindfold Play (15 mins): Play a very simple game against a weak engine without looking at the board.
Day 5–7: Short Calculation Exercises
Warm-up (10-15 mins): Visualize simple endgame positions (e.g., pawn races). Practice calculating sequences like pawn pushes or king moves.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve medium-level puzzles (1400–1600 rating). Aim to calculate the solution fully before moving the pieces.
Puzzle Streak (15 mins): Use Chess.com or Lichess to solve as many puzzles as possible in a row to build pattern recognition speed.
Game Analysis (30 mins): Pick another master game but pause more often. Try to calculate 2-3 moves ahead for key moments. Compare your calculation with the actual game.
Week 2: Intermediate Calculation – Depth and Accuracy
Goal: Start calculating longer sequences and evaluating resulting positions.

Day 8–10: Candidate Moves and Calculation Trees
Warm-up (10 mins): Visualize a random position and calculate all possible moves for one side (candidate moves). Imagine the resulting positions for each.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve harder puzzles (1600–1800 rating). Write down all candidate moves and calculate 3-4 moves deep.
Calculation Exercise (30 mins): From a complex position, write out a calculation tree for at least 2-3 candidate moves. Compare your analysis with the engine.
Endgame Calculation Practice (20 mins): Practice calculating pawn races, king opposition, and basic rook endgames.
Day 11–14: Calculation Under Pressure
Warm-up (10 mins): Solve a few easy puzzles quickly to warm up your tactical vision.
Timed Tactics (30 mins): Solve puzzles with a timer (e.g., 3 minutes per puzzle). Focus on accuracy under time pressure.
Blitz Practice (30 mins): Play a few blitz games (5+0 or 3+2). Force yourself to calculate quickly in key positions. After each game, review any tactical mistakes.
Game Analysis (30 mins): Pick a sharp tactical game (e.g., Tal or Kasparov) and pause to calculate critical moves. Compare your calculation to the master’s moves.
Week 3: Advanced Visualization and Complex Positions
Goal: Handle multi-move sequences and improve visualization accuracy.

Day 15–17: Deep Calculation
Warm-up (10 mins): Visualize a random position. Calculate a sequence of 4-5 moves for both sides without moving the pieces.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve hard puzzles (1800–2000 rating). Take your time to calculate all variations and visualize the final position.
Positional Calculation (30 mins): Use a positional puzzle or a complex middlegame position. Calculate candidate moves and evaluate resulting positions.
Blindfold Practice (20 mins): Play a game without looking at the board or visualize the moves of a master game entirely in your head.
Day 18–21: Practical Calculation
Warm-up (10 mins): Imagine a simple pawn endgame and calculate all possible pawn moves for both sides.
Game Practice (30 mins): Play rapid games (10+5 or 15+10). Focus on accurate calculation in critical moments. Analyze the games afterward, especially missed tactics.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve puzzles with longer sequences (2000+ rating). Practice writing down your calculations before solving.
Game Analysis (30 mins): Focus on games with complex tactical middlegames. Pause frequently to calculate and compare your thoughts with the master’s moves.
Week 4: Mastery and Integration
Goal: Combine visualization, calculation, and evaluation into your chess play.

Day 22–24: Real-Game Calculation
Warm-up (10 mins): Visualize a random position. Calculate a 5-move sequence for both sides.
Game Practice (30 mins): Play longer time control games (15+10 or 30+0). Focus on deliberate calculations during the game. Afterward, analyze your thought process.
Tactics Training (30 mins): Solve puzzles from real games (2000+ rating or chess books like “Chess Tactics from Scratch”). Write down your thought process.
Blindfold Practice (20 mins): Play a simple position or game in your head.
Day 25–28: Advanced Calculation Techniques
Warm-up (10 mins): Visualize a middlegame position and imagine 3-4 possible plans for each side.
Complex Puzzles (30 mins): Solve puzzles with multiple variations or defensive resources (e.g., from Jacob Aagaard’s “Calculation” or similar books).
Practical Game Analysis (30 mins): Analyze your own games, focusing on missed calculations. Practice recalculating critical positions.
Endgame Calculation (20 mins): Practice solving complex endgame studies.
Day 29–30: Synthesis and Review
Day 29: Solve a mix of puzzles from all difficulty levels. Focus on recognizing patterns and calculating accurately. Play a long game and analyze it thoroughly.
Day 30: Review your progress. Revisit positions or puzzles you struggled with earlier. Play a few games to test your improved calculation skills.
Tools and Resources:
Puzzle Platforms: Chess.com, Lichess, or CT-ART.
